Cards can be generated and exhausted en masse. It is up to the player to reshape their decks in beneficial ways. \n The most common way of changing the deck comes in the form of two special cards, both of which can only be created during combat. \n The card Dream will create new cards until your hand is full, all of which cost 0 energy this turn. The class of the cards generated depends on the intent of the enemy you are dreaming about: an attacking enemy will provide you with Ironclad cards, a buffing enemy with Defect cards, and a debuffing enemy with Silent cards. Dreams are powerful, but, since they are generated in your discard pile, will often take a while to get drawn. \n The card Nightmare does very little on its own. It is practically a curse, allowing you to apply 1 measly poison to an enemy, for the ungainly cost of 1 energy. They stay in your hand at the end of your turn, so at least you only have to draw them once. However, fill up your hand with too many Nightmares and there will be little space for those Dreams to pay off. Mostly, Nightmares are a drawback to an otherwise powerful effect. There are cards, however, that let you benefit from those Nightmares in your hand. \n \n The rest is up to you to discover.","mts_version":"3.8.0","sts_version":"01-23-2019","dependencies":["basemod","stslib"],"optional_dependencies":[]},{"name":"SpireLocations","version":"1.1.1","authors":["Pandemonium"],"credits":"","description":"Adds modifiers to nodes, with various effects.","mts_version":"3.18.2","sts_version":"12-22-2020","dependencies":["basemod","stslib"],"optional_dependencies":[]},{"name":"StSLib","version":"2.10.0","authors":["kiooeht"],"credits":"\n  Contributors: The_Evil_Pickle, Reina, Rin Camelia, erasels, EatYourBeetS, Jedi, Vex, Mistress Alison, Alchyr, Bryan, Pandemonium, NellyDevo, herbix \n  Translation: Jedi (Russian), Rita-B (ZHS), rainfoxest (ZHS, ZHT), Mwalls (ZHS), Tsurumaki Maki (Korean), Celicath (Korean), Diamsword (French), red5h4d0w (French)","description":"A collection of keywords and mechanics for other Slay the Spire mods to use.","mts_version":"3.24.0","sts_version":"12-18-2022","dependencies":["basemod"],"optional_dependencies":[]},{"name":"Subterfuge","version":"0.1","authors":["rinM (RRCN#7495)"],"credits":"","description":"Subterfuge: Silent Expansion Mod \n \nCurrently adds: \n \n51 cards\n6 relics\n1 event \n1 potion \n \nCurrent build: 25 Mar 2023","mts_version":"3.29.0","sts_version":"03-07-2022","dependencies":["basemod","stslib"],"optional_dependencies":[]},{"name":"Testers Mod","version":"1.8.1","authors":["Lord Raptor Jesus"],"credits":"Basemod, ModTheSpire, StS Discord, Valve","description":"Welcome to the Aperture Science Cooperative Spire-Slaying Initiative, the latest and greatest in Aperture Science Testing Tracks, designed to simulate the various different floors of the Spire.
